- Never kill an animal or eat some animal's meat (as I can't know the conditions it lived its life, most often its [horrendous](https://youtube.com/watch?v=8gqwpfEcBjI))
- Support animal welfare in any way I can (i.e. by [donating to organizations](https://youtube.com/watch?v=kWcPg8t1kJ4))
- Be compassionate to others, try see their point of view always
- Waste no time. Sort tasks by priority and just do them. One task at a time. Surround myself with people that share my values. Optimize every second.
- Never get jealous or compare myself to others. Just do better and grow. No one cares about me or how I feel, just focus on being kind & useful.
- Never complain. Never blame anyone on anything. Simply learn from mistakes and move forward.
