title: Lock In
---

I usually put [this](https://open.spotify.com/track/2dlWl0aLvdQ64L2ONG0O5y) on. Or [any song by Nils](/music) really. And work.

I have a system of [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) & [Linear](https://linear.app) that outline priority the tasks should be worked on. And I do tasks one by one always by priority. I use [Bike](https://hogbaysoftware.com/bike/) as deep thought outliner as I disect tasks to smaller ones.

Current task is shown in top right corner with [NotchBar](https://github.com/navtoj/notchbar) so I do not get distracted on things. I always see my current task to do.

Ideally I have feeds like X one blocked but for now I do self control on it as its bit tricky to do it properly. Requires extension to be built which I will do soon. iOS more tricky. But it mostly boils down to self control.
