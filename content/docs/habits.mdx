I briefly shared how I do habits in [old wiki](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/focusing/habits). But the process has changed since then.

In short, I get notifs throughout the day to complete the habits. At the end of the day I make sure I go over all of them and try get all of them completed every single day.

Habits are the core part of the day and should be completed no matter what happens in the day. In practice its not often easy to complete all.
