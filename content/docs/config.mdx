> Here are macOS/iOS apps, CLIs + their configs I use. All config files are in [config repo](https://github.com/nikivdev/config).

> Dark appearance. All apps are in one desktop since there is delay in switching between macOS multiple desktops. Dock is hidden.

> Light appearance. Use light themes when outside or when there is glare from the sun as it makes text more readable.

## Replicate macOS setup

[This](https://1focus.notion.site/Mac-clean-setup-ee58edc4a991483491333e9e3fc20292) lists all settings I use on macOS.

See [.flox](https://github.com/nikivdev/.flox) repo as it lists my global env setup for all executables/daemons I run.

There is currently no automated way to replicate below setup so you would have to manually download apps, symlink configs etc.

## macOS Apps

[This](https://gist.github.com/nikivdev/161e9a719b22c23af10a6eeeb2d08040) shows all apps I have in my `/Applications`. Below is description of apps I do use:

- [Karabiner](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/karabiner/) is core tool I use to remap my keyboard. It's the tool on which my entire mac workflow is built. All keys on my keyboard are dual purpose keys. Press once, it enters the key, hold together with another key and do custom action. I have 100's of these custom actions all within 1 second of activation for me. i.e. `a+w` is `control+w` or `w+k` opens Safari. See [karabiner/karabiner.edn](karabiner/karabiner.edn) for config.
- [Alfred](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/alfred) / [Raycast](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/raycast) for everything search related.
- [Keyboard Maestro](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/) for all automation needs that are not search related. Both Alfred/Raycast and KM are activated from Karabiner directly. I share all my KM macros [here](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros). One example of KM macro is [using AppleScript](https://www.macobserver.com/tips/quick-tip/change-light-dark-mode-applescript-app/) to switch [between light/dark macOS appearances](https://x.com/nikivdev/status/1311336647338983432). As appearances are switched, the themes get updated accordingly on most apps.
- [BetterTouchTool](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/bettertouchtool) for custom trackpad gestures. Specifically love three finger swipe left/right to move between tabs in [Safari](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/web/browsers/safari). Three finger swipe up to create new tab. Three down to close. Four finger swipe global swipe to show Safari. Four to right to open [Cursor](https://cursor.sh). Four left to open [Warp](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/unix/shell/warp).
- [Fantastical](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/fantastical) to manage my calendar and events.
- [CleanShot](https://getcleanshot.com) for quick editing of screenshots/screencasts.
- [Transmission](https://www.transmissionbt.com/) for downloading [torrents](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/networking/peer-to-peer/bittorrent).
- [1Password](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/1password) to keep all passwords and secret info. I prefer to use Passkeys or Single Sign On via GitHub/Google.
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.sh/) as my main code editor. Use [many extensions](https://reflect.site/g/nikiv-personal/cursor/a675292841a94fbb960fb10fdd7eefa5) with it. Keep my UI minimal and useful.
- [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com) as visual Git client. It gives nice overview of files changed, what branches exist and more. I have custom actions bound to go through Git tasks fast.
- [Ghostty](https://mitchellh.com/ghostty) as primary terminal together with [Fish Shell](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/unix/shell/fish).
- [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) to search APIs fast.
- [Xcode](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/xcode/) to write swift code.
- [Telegram](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/telegram) as my main messenger. Love its stickers, speed and simplicity.
- [Discord](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/discord) as main way to interact with various communities.
- [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com) as my email client. Does good job of sorting mail and getting out of my way when writing/replying to things.
- [Figma](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/design/figma) as my primary design tool.
- [Rive](https://rive.app) to do animations
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) to stream all [my music](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/music). Keep all my liked songs in a [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0ERn0U4qZIKC8Dy7RrMMsn).
- [IINA](https://github.com/lhc70000/iina) to play video files of movies/series.
- [Reflect](https://reflect.app) to write/search notes and my daily journal + tasks
- [Linear](https://linear.app) to make/check on issues across different teams (I power all GitHub issues of mine through Linear, all in one workspace)
- [SnippetsLab](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/) for snippets
- [Yaak](https://yaak.app) for testing out HTTP requests
- [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) preferred editor for Go code together with Cursor
- [Safari](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/web/browsers/safari) as main browser for everything.
- [Google Chrome Canary](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/web/browsers/google-chrome) for web development as its [dev tools](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/web/browsers/google-chrome/chrome-dev-tools) are superior to Safari
- [Arc](https://arc.net) for social feeds (X, Reddit, Bluesky, ..)
- [Safari Technology Preview](https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/) to test some new WebKit features

## macOS CLIs

Mostly use [Flox](https://gist.github.com/nikivdev/f0ae36e6dc43151110b086aedab349d7), [Brew](https://gist.github.com/nikivdev/b94ec2e5167126b3511d32ee208397ae), [Bun global packages](https://gist.github.com/nikivdev/7a83ee6d87dbddf0c409acb3113d7e6f) for global executables.

All config files are part of this repo and they are symlinked from their original places into `~/src/config/..`.

This include configs for [fish](fish), [karabiner](karabiner) and more.

I use `Test` shortcut to prototype new actions/ideas quickly. I then duplicate the working prototype & give it appropriate name. I use the same prototyping idea with [KM macros](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros).

## iOS Control Center

Here is how my control center looks (I mostly only use the first screen only from them though):

## All Library

Will map all apps I have installed as a list in future but for now here are some screens from App Library.

## Blocked apps

Often times I have TikTok & some other apps blocked on schedule using [Jomo](https://jomo.so). I can still open the app where I would see this:

    heigth="400"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikivdev/media/refs/heads/main/config/25-sept/jomo-blocked-app.png"
  />
</a>

My rules in Jomo are:

    heigth="400"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikivdev/media/refs/heads/main/config/25-sept/always-jomo-block.png"
  />
</a>

  />

  />
</a>

Where I rarely use the `Focus` one as it is supposed to be opt in and its cumbersome to activate a Focus session. But Always one is great in that it adds friction to using TikTok nearly always.

And Passive session forces me not to open IG/TikTok in morning too which is great.

## Discuss macOS/iOS

I made a [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/BBKnQU4_rty6_942PFbPbw) to discuss all things macOS/iOS. Karabiner related questions can be asked [here](https://t.me/+UDlL5H7VIwAVK0_7).
